Read this if you want to compile it yourself.

To compile it you'll need:
[Module]
- Python Mega Widget: http://pmw.sourceforge.net/
- Python Imaging Lib: http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
- mtTkinter:          http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/mtTkinter
[Software]
- Python 2.7.3:               http://www.python.org/
- Cx_Freeze for Python 2.7.3: http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/

METHOD 1:
Once you have these module, you will compile it.
Open CMD, on windows and type the followings command:
> cd %PATH TO THIS FOLDER%
> %PATHTOPYTHON%/python.exe setup.pyw build

Here's an example:
> cd C:/Project/Python/FunctionCalculator
> C:/Python27/python.exe setup.pyw build

METHOD 2:
You can create a batch file(.bat) in the source folder
and just add the followings line:
> echo off
> %PATHTOPYTHON%/python.exe setup.pyw build

Here's an example:
> echo off
> C:/Python27/python.exe setup.pyw build

Be sure to remove the (">") if you copy

Now, both of these method should create you a folder build,
inside that folder you'll have the compiled application.
